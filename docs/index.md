This tutorial presents a workshop on GitObs SDI. Spatial Data Infrastructres are typically build up around a
catalogue, a data access layer (api's) and a data visualisation tool. The SDI introduced in this tutorial is fully maintained from Git and is operated using a set of docker containers running locally, on a Virtual Machine or in a Cloud infrastructure. 

On the tutorial some common open source tools are introduced:

- quarto 
- mapserver
- pycsw
- pygeodatacrawlwer (pygeometa/owslib/gdal)
- TerriaJS

Git has a central role in the training, it is for example suggested to facilitate software development and deployment, content co-creation and management as well as community feedback. Experience with Git and Docker are required before starting this workshop. 

You can also access the [slides](./slides/) of the workshop.

We hope you enjoy the materials, 

Paul and Tom.
